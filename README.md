SOFTWARE DEFINED STORAGE:

Can help address many of the challenges:
- Scaling out, instead of scaling up: You can add additional servers and storage to the software defined storage cluster to improve performance & capacity. (No need to buy larger individual storage systems)
- Software-based = more agility (Intelligence not imbeded in proprietary HW, but in SW)
- A shift to OpenSource development is enabled by SDS > Faster integration + Innov

REDHAT:
Redhat offers 2 software-defined, scale-out storage solutions:
- Ceph Storage = Unified Storage solution for block-based, object-based, and file-based data
- Gluster Storage = Focus on providing scale-out storage solution for file-based data
